### What is this?

This is a web app with a backend written in Ruby on Rails and a frontend written with React.  It's held together with wishes, dreams, and the webpacker gem in Rails 5.1.

### How can I run it?

You'll need postgres installed on your system, along with all the other dependencies for Rails development. You'll also need [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), which is a new dependency for 5.1.

Once you have the repo cloned, run `bin/setup` and it *might* get everything set up for you.  Then run `bin/server` to launch both halves of the server.  Your mileage may vary.
